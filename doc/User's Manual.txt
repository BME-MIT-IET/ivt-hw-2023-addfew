The controls to the Game are fairly simple:

1. WASD keys are used to move around instead of arrow keys.
2. Space bar is used to jump.
3. Clicking Spacebar rapidly will make player fly for some time.
4. Colliding with monster will result in game over.
5. Clicking on highscore will let you see all time highscore.
