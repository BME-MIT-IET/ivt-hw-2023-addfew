The Tom/Timmyâ€™s Dreamland Journal is a 2D Platformer game engine. Game heavily
revolves around the interaction of the objects with their surrounding in a small 2D
world. Though, not so eye pleasing, it have some low level graphics.
It uses the concept like velocity, Gravity, Collision detection etc. The main goal 
of this assignment is to improve the working of the game using various techniques and
tests. 
The Junit Test and Manual prototype testing have been applied to test the game 
environment so it is error and bug free whether when the objects are interacting with 
each other or a highscore is getting written on certain file is right or not. 

Code Coverage have been applied to see how much of the source code has been tested and 
in case it is not sufficent, the unit tests are going to be extended so most of the 
source code has been tested.
